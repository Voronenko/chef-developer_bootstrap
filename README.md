# Summary 
Bootstrap project used to setup environments during my R&D activities and 'pet' projects

## OS
I usually use ubuntu neither 12.04.3 LTS (Precise Pangolin), Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal).
I am also adapting 13.10 (Saucy Salamander), but it still has some incompatibilities on packages.

## Usage scenario

* Configure development boxes on your ESX server 
* Configure development boxes with Vagrant on your virtual box
* Configure your bare metal development workstation

## Software installed

### Standalone usage
Once you cloned repository on a target box, run init.sh;
For ubuntu 13.10 recommended way is to run init_1310.sh

By default, it will install bootstrap software packages listed below:
 
- Git
- Ruby 1.9.3 (dev)
- OpsCode CHEF [https://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Home](https://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Home)
- Librarian-chef [https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian-chef](https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian-chef)
- Berkshelf (for Vagrant based provisioning) [http://berkshelf.com/](http://berkshelf.com/)

### Vagrant usage

Install Oracle VirtualBox [http://www.virtualbox.org/], Vagrant [http://vagrantup.com/], 
* Vagrant berkshelf plugin [vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf]
* Vagrant vbguest plugin [vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest]

*vagrant-berkshelf* is a Vagrant plugin to add Berkshelf integration to the Chef provisioners

*vagrant-vbguest* is a Vagrant plugin which automatically installs the host's VirtualBox Guest Additions on the guest system. 


Clone developer bootstrap repository. Using *Vagrantfile* as an example choose necessary roles for your box. Use *vagrant* environment file to adjust your software settings and versions.

Use *vagrant up* to boot up the box.

Note: Vagrantfile is based on official Vagrant Ubuntu 12.04 Precise 32bit image. At present moment it has outdated ruby & chef version installed. By default during provision custom init_vagrant.sh script is executed. In a result, virtua–¥ server is upgraded with ruby 1.9.3 and more recent chef-solo version.

## Directories purpose

### cookbooks
Official cookbooks for widely used software


### cookbook-project
I use this directory to checkout cookbooks that are not available for the public, and are specifically related to project specific environment configuration

### databags
Directory contains optional project specific file artifacts for cookbooks.

### environments
Contains preferences to package versions, vendors and machine wide configuraiton for packages installed


### nodes
Contains instructions to configure predefined set of the software on specific workstation basing on it's role (lamp box, java box, big data box, MEAN box, etc.

### roles
Contains combination of recipes (roles) to configure workstation for predefined needs.
By default roles are:

- gui - installs set of handy tools, so that workstation can be used for GUI development
- sql - installs set of tools for efficient work with MySQL (Percona, MariaDB) box
- lamp_debug - configures workstation for lamp development

## How to use 

Manual steps are:

*sudo chef-solo -c solo.rb -j nodes/nodename.json*

Vagrant steps are:
*vagrant up*

### Vagrant debugging configuration

Suggested recipe requires minimum configuration to run (PHPStorm)

* in project settings/server register vagrant server
 (You can use some wildcard domain like PROJECT.lvh.me to map test domain name to vagrant box)
* in phpstorm set XDEBUG_SESSION_START variable (PHPSTORM or whatever)
* Put breakpoint, launch debugging session (for example using handy chrome helper [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xdebug-helper/eadndfjplgieldjbigjakmdgkmoaaaoc]
